Also check out our [home page](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab).\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n### Fast-SL\r\nFast-SL enables an efficient enumeration of higher order synthetic lethals in metabolic networks, which may help uncover previously unknown genetic interactions and combinatorial drug targets. Fast-SL is compatible with the COBRA toolbox for MATLAB and LP solvers such as Gurobi.\r\n* [GitHub Repo](http://github.com/RamanLab/FastSL)\r\n* [Original Research Article in _Bioinformatics_](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv352)\r\n* Funding Acknowledgement: [Department of Biotechnology, Government of India](http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ReactionMiner\r\nReactionMiner is a tool to predict (bio)chemical reactions using graph mining.\r\n* [GitHub Repo](http://github.com/RamanLab/ReactionMiner)\r\n* Funding Acknowledgement: This work was supported by the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in/) grant CSE/14-15/5643/NFSC/SAYN to Sayan Ranu and the [Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE)](https://web.iitm.ac.in/ibse) at IIT Madras.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n* Karthik Raman (@karthikraman)\r\n* Aditya Pratapa (@adityaprat)\r\n* Aarthi R (@aarthi466)\r\n* Karthik Azhagesan (@karthik1290)\r\n* Aravind Sankar (@aravindsankar28)\r\n* Sivaratna Kumari (@sivaratna)\r\n* Srikiran S (@sriki18)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nKarthik Raman (kraman @ iitm&middot;ac&middot;in)",

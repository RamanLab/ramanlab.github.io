## Projects
### Fast-SL
Fast-SL enables an efficient enumeration of higher order synthetic lethals in metabolic networks, which may help uncover previously unknown genetic interactions and combinatorial drug targets. Fast-SL is compatible with the COBRA toolbox for MATLAB and LP solvers such as Gurobi.
